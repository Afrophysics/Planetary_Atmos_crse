  abstract = {The discovery that Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, has an atmosphere and that methane is a signi®cant constituent of it, was the starting point for a systematic study of Titan's atmospheric organic chemistry. Since then, the results from numerous ground-based observations and two ¯ybys of Titan, by Voyager I and II, have led to experimental laboratory simulation studies and photochemical and physical modeling. All these works have provided a more detailed picture of Titan. We report here a continuation of such a study performing an experimental laboratory simulation of Titan's atmospheric chemistry, and considering the two physical phases involved: gases and aerosols. Concerning the gaseous phase, we report the ®rst detection of C4N2 and we propose possible atmospheric abundances for 70 organic compounds on Titan's upper atmosphere. Concerning the solid phase, we have characterized aerosol analogues synthesized in conditions close to those of Titan's environment, using elemental analysis, pyrolysis, solubility studies and infrared spectroscopy. \# 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {We use a stochastic approach in order to investigate the production and evolution of aerosols in Titan’s atmosphere. The simulation initiates from the benzene molecules observed in the thermosphere and follows their evolution to larger aromatic structures through reaction with gas-phase radical species. Aromatics are allowed to collide and provide the ﬁrst primary particles, which further grow to aggregates through coagulation. We also consider for the ﬁrst time the contribution of heterogenous processes at the surface of the particles, which are described by the deposition of the formed aromatic structures on the surface of the particles, and also through the chemical reaction with radical species. Our results demonstrate that the evolution of aerosols in terms of size, shape, and density is a result of competing processes between surface growth, coagulation, and sedimentation. Furthermore, our simulations clearly demonstrate the presence of a spherical growth region in the upper atmosphere followed by a transition to an aggregate growth region below. The transition altitude ranges between 500 and 600 km based on the parameters of the simulation.},

[2008]. Planet. Space Sci. 56, 669–707). We set the mass production of aerosols in the thermosphere to 3 Â 10À14 g cmÀ2 sÀ1 and follow the evolution of the particles due to coagulation, sedimentation and atmospheric mixing. We use the observed aerosol phase functions at 100 km to constrain the particle’s charge density to 15 e/lm. With this charge density, the microphysical model predictions for the number of monomers, and the particle size and density, are in good agreement with the DISR measurements. In addition, we derive a new refractive index for the aerosols based on the single scattering albedo inferred from DISR measurements. The imaginary index is larger than previous estimates based on laboratory analogs, with an increasing absorption toward the near-IR. Our simulation provides a good description of the particle properties above 80 km, but we ﬁnd that condensation effects must be included in order to interpret aerosol characteristics at lower altitudes.},

Observations of a large high- to low- phase brightness ratio, combined with the blue color of the haze (indicative of Rayleigh scattering), suggest that the haze particles are fractal aggregates, perhaps analogous to the photochemical hazes on Titan. Therefore, studying the Pluto hazes can shed light on the similarities and differences between the Pluto and Titan atmospheres. We model the haze distribution using the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres assuming that the distribution is shaped by downward transport and coagulation of particles originating from photochemistry. Hazes composed of both purely spherical and purely fractal aggregate particles are considered. General agreement between model results and solar occultation observations is obtained with aggregate particles when the downward mass flux of photochemical products is equal to the column-integrated methane destruction rate ∼1.2×10−14gcm−2s−1, while for spherical particles the mass flux must be 2–3 times greater. This flux is nearly identical to the haze production flux of Titan previously obtained by comparing microphysical model results to Cassini observations. The aggregate particle radius is sensitive to particle charging effects, and a particle charge to radius ratio of 30e−/µm is necessary to produce ∼0.1–0.2µm aggregates near Pluto's surface, in accordance with forward scattering measurements. Such a particle charge to radius ratio is 2–4 times higher than those previously obtained for Titan. Hazes composed of spheres with the same particle charge to radius ratio have particles that are 4 times smaller at Pluto's surface. These results further suggest that the haze particles are fractal aggregates. We also consider the effect of condensation of HCN, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 on the haze particles, which may play an important role in shaping their altitude and size distributions.},

  abstract = {The stellar occultation by Pluto on June 9, 1988, was observed with a high-speed CCD photometer attached to the 0.9-m telescope aboard NASA's Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO). The occultation lightcurve, which probed two regions on the sunrise limb separated by about 200 km, reveals a clear upper atmosphere that overlies an extinction layer with an abrupt upper boundary. The observations demonstrate that the extinction layer extends along the portion of the sunrise limb bounded by the immersion and emersion regions, as well as long the corresponding portion of the sunset limb on the opposite side of the planet. In all, the total limb probed by the KAO data for extinction represents nearly half of Pluto's circumference. Hence, the extinction layer may surround the entire planet. A model atmosphere is presented, from which is derived an occultation lightcurve that closely matches the data. In addition to the standard parameters describing the occultation curve by an isothermal atmosphere, our model includes the radius of the upper boundary of the extinction and the radius of unit observed optical depth as free parameters. Fits of this model to the immersion and emersion lightcurves show no significant differences in the derived atmospheric structure. A preliminary geometrical solution, based on three occultation chords, yields a half-light radius of 1214 ± 20 km. At this level, the mean scale height derived from the model fits to the KAO data is 59.7 ± 1.5 km. The corresponding ratio of temperature to mean molecular weight is 4.2 ± 0.4°K/amu, with the principal source of error arising from the uncertainty in the mass of Pluto. The extinction layer, whose upper boundary lies 25 km below the half-light level, has a minimum thickness of 46 km, a minimum vertical optical depth of 0.19, and a scale height of 33.4 ± 6.9 km. For a pure methane atmosphere, our results imply (for the clear atmosphere at the half-light level) a temperature of 67 ± 6°K, a number density of 8.3 × 1013 cm−3, and a pressure of 0.78 ωbar. Our occultation data are also consistent with a predominantly nitrogen atmosphere (such as that of Titan), in which case the temperature would be 117 ± 11°K. The substantially smaller scale height of the extinction layer may arise from properties of the “particles” causing the extinction or may indicate a lower temperature in this region. Since our analysis indicates that the extinction layer is optically thick at the limb of Pluto, determinations of Pluto's radius by methods that use reflected light, such as speckle interferometry and observations of the mutual events, give results that refer to the “visible disk” of Pluto and not on the planet's solid surface. Unit optical depth of the extinction layer (observed along the line of sight) lies at 1174 ± 20 km, a level consistent with the radius of Pluto derived from the mutual events (1142 ± 21 km). The mutual event radius is also consistent with the deepest level probed by the occultation: it lies at a radius of 1143 ± 20 km, which represents an upper limit on the surface radius. For a pure methane atmosphere, a surface pressure as low as 3 ωbar (the vapor pressure of methane at 50°K) would be consistent with the occultation data.},

  abstract = {NASA’s New Horizons (NH) Pluto–Kuiper Belt (PKB) mission was selected for development on 29 November 2001 following a competitive selection resulting from a NASA mission Announcement of Opportunity. New Horizons is the first mission to the Pluto system and the Kuiper belt, and will complete the reconnaissance of the classical planets. New Horizons was launched on 19 January 2006 on a Jupiter Gravity Assist (JGA) trajectory toward the Pluto system, for a 14 July 2015 closest approach to Pluto; Jupiter closest approach occurred on 28 February 2007. The ∼400 kg spacecraft carries seven scientific instruments, including imagers, spectrometers, radio science, a plasma and particles suite, and a dust counter built by university students. NH will study the Pluto system over an 8-month period beginning in early 2015. Following its exploration of the Pluto system, NH will go on to reconnoiter one or two 30–50 kilometer diameter Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) if the spacecraft is in good health and NASA approves an extended mission. New Horizons has already demonstrated the ability of Principal Investigator (PI) led missions to use nuclear power sources and to be launched to the outer solar system. As well, the mission has demonstrated the ability of non-traditional entities, like the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) to explore the outer solar system, giving NASA new programmatic flexibility and enhancing the competitive options when selecting outer planet missions. If successful, NH will represent a watershed development in the scientific exploration of a new class of bodies in the solar system—dwarf planets, of worlds with exotic volatiles on their surfaces, of rapidly (possibly hydrodynamically) escaping atmospheres, and of giant impact derived satellite systems. It will also provide other valuable contributions to planetary science, including: the first dust density measurements beyond 18 AU, cratering records that shed light on both the ancient and present-day KBO impactor population down to tens of meters, and a key comparator to the puzzlingly active, former dwarf planet (now satellite of Neptune) called Triton which is in the same size class as the small planets Eris and Pluto.},
